## What is multiplicative persistence?

- Multiplying all of the digits of a number _x_ by each other, repeating with the product until a single digit is reached.
- The number of steps required is known as the _multiplicative persistence_, and the final digit obtained is called the _multiplicative digital root_ of _x_.
