# Persistence Calculator

## About

A simple multiplicative persistence calculator coded in Python.

## What is multiplicative persistence?

- Multiplying all of the digits of a number _x_ by each other, repeating with the product until a single digit is reached.
- The number of steps required is known as the _multiplicative persistence_, and the final digit obtained is called the _multiplicative digital root_ of _x_. 
- FUN FACT: The number 277777788888899 has the highest multiplicative persistence at 11. Use this calculator to experiment with any number you can think of!
